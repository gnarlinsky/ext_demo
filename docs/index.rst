   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Internal documentation/design documents
-----------------------------------------------
So here go decisions like the schema, and stuff that didn't go into the
individual 'Internal documentation' parts of each py file

Scripts
---------------
Not sure where to put or categorize this...........
But here should talk about cover.sh

** ``Cover.sh`` ** - The line ``open htmlcov/index.html`` opens the HTML
coverage information with your system's default browser. But this may only work
in OS X, where the ``open`` command opens directories and files with the
default application for the file's extension â€” so you might want to comment out
that statement.
